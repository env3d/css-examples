I am developing a piece of simulation software to model prey and predator behaviour.
You can see the app at: http://css.operatoroverload.com/exercise/ 

I want the software to present the user with different UI for different devices.  For instance, 
when view on a computer, the keyboard will be used change the simulation view.

When viewed on a mobile phone, since there will be no physical keyboard, several 
buttons will be displayed for the user to manipulate the simulation.

Currently, there is no styling.  Your job is to create the various css rules to make the UI 
behave in the following way:  http://youtu.be/CNJoEgr0IHY?hd=1 

Below are the details for each display mode:
