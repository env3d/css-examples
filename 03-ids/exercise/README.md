# HTML id and page fragment exercise

[index.html](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/env3d/css-examples/master/03-ids/exercise/index.html)
contains data from vancouver's craiglist.  The data was pulled
on October 9, 2017.  The following 3 categories are included:

1. Rentals
2. Cars
3. Furnitures

The page is linked to an external stylesheet, which is currently missing.  Your
job is to modify the HTML to make the navigation bar functional, and style the
page.

## Exercise

1. Assign IDs to each of the 3 h1 elements, named them 'rentals', 'cars', and 'furnitures'
2. In the <nav> section, have each of the link refer to the corresponding page fragment
3. Test the page to make sure that the links are working, like this: http://youtu.be/znYTnH0rKY0?hd=1 
4. Use http://css.operatoroverload.com/03-ids/nav/ as a guide, create a stylesheet that resembles the 
following: http://youtu.be/k79C2sFTkEk?hd=1
5. Things to note:
   1. For h1 elements, create a padding-top of 80px so the navigation bar won't overlap with it
   2. Article elements must have alternating background colors, and have a padding and margin of 10px all around
   3. Be sure to change the colors for links using pseudo classes
