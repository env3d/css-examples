The body of this webpage has 3 direct children: header, nav, and main.  

Since these elements are rectangular boxes, I want to stack these boxes on top 
of each other with no margin.  I have set it up in my index.css code.

However, the result still has a margin in between the elements, can you fix it?

IMPORTANT:  Use only INLINE style to fix it.  Do not modify index.css!!!
